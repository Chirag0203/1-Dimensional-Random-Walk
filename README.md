# 1-Dimensional-Random-Walk
# I've attempted to understand the mathematical model of the 1 Dimensional Random Walk. I've written the code incorporated into this repository to visualize two things:
# 1) The variation of the positions of the particle with the steps taken.
# 2) The model's probability distribution.
